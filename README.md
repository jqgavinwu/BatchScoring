# Project Name
Prototype code for model deployment
## Code purpose
These files showcase the template with which my team packages up a machine learning model for testing, profiling and ultimately, deployment. The preprocessing part utilizes fully the knowledge we gain during exploratory analysis and feature engineering in the form of a data dictionary. The testing part leverages the testing harness that I developed to methodically introduce anomalies/exceptions in order to break the scoring function.
